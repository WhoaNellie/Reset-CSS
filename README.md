# Reset-CSS

## About
This is a very paired down version of a reset CSS that uses the * selector for minimum specificity, defaults to border-box styling, an accesible line-height of 1.5 and a min-font size of 16pt.

## Usage
Download the reset.css file and link to it before any of your main styling, or just copy and paste the file contents at the top of your first-linked css file.

## Future Improvements

* Scrolling behavior
* Normalization
* Allowing some elements to have default margin or padding (buttons, tables, inputs)
* Adjust default font-size
